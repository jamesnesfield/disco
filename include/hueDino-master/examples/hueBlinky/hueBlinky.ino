 /******************************************************************* 
  The typical 'hello world' of embedded development, blinky! In this 
  example sketch the hueDino library queries the Hue Bridge for all 
  established groups. If groups are found it then toggles all groups 
  on, and then off, every 3 seconds. The sequence of On and Off 
  states are printed to the terminal if '#define DEBUG' is uncommented 
  in hueDino.h.
  
  Check out the included Arduino sketch examples to get started!
